# AffilGood 🕺🏿

AffilGood provides annotated datasets and tools to improve the accuracy of attributing scientific works to research organizations, especially in multilingual and complex contexts. The accurate attribution of scientific works to research organizations is hindered by the lack of openly available manually annotated data--in particular when multilingual and complex affiliation strings are considered. The AffilGood framework introduced in this paper addresses this gap. We identify three sub-tasks relevant for institution name disambiguation and make available annotated datasets and tools aimed at each of them, including i) a dataset annotated with affiliation spans in noisy automatically-extracted strings; ii) a dataset annotated with named entities for the identification of organizations and their locations; iii) seven datasets annotated with ROR identifiers for the evaluation of entity-linking systems. In addition, we describe, evaluate and make available newly developed tools that use these datasets to provide solutions for each of the identified sub-tasks. Our results confirm the value of the developed resources and methods in addressing key challenges in institution name disambiguation.

This is the official repository for the paper "AffilGood: Building reliable institution name disambiguation tools to improve scientific literature analysis", published in the Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) 2024 Workshop at ACL 2024 Conference.
